Define models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to use Azure Digital Twins Service.
I do not need advices how to do it. I want you to cre`te definitions for me.

I want to define my models as follow:
CentralUnit
property: name - name configured by user

ControlHub
property: name - name configured by user
property: location - location of the sensor specified by user
property: status - operational status may be [on, off, na, partial]

TermoSensor
property: name - name configured by user
property: location - location of the sensor specified by user
property: temperature - current temperature in given location
property: status - operational status may be [on, off, na, partial]

The topology of my twins network is as follow.
CentralUnit - one main unit on network
ControlHub - each hub connected  to CentralUnit
TermoSensor - each termosensor connected to ControlHub only connection to one hub is allowed

Please define modules for these 3 models. Please take into account relations between them as stated above. If you think that some main properties are missed feel free to add it.
